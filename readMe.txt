Steps to run code:
Requirments:
google account to use colab

Process:
upload  ipynb file in google colab
Change runtime of colab to gpu
Then start running the code cell by cell
In this process you need to verify your gmail
Download the patient files from CHB-MIT dataset and upload in google drive
If you want to run more candidates repeat the whole process with 2 new fresh candidates
It will take around 2-3 hours to run code for 3 patients.
